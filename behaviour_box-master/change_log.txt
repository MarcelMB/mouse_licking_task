| * 3c724d3	 format
| * 529085e	 added break on wrong choice
| * bfe4a2c	 (origin/punishment) now the program reports the first lick detected after the trial; whether it was a hit, miss, or wrong choice
| * dc25ca3	 deleted the response parts of the data frame because it was unnecessary and I am setting the arduino to report on that any way
| * c0991bf	 working on the break early
| * b7816dc	 made waterVol a byte value; because it is never going to be above 255 with the water valve
| | * 4382358	 (origin/hotfix00) speaker pin usage fixed, removed noise creation in senselick routine
| | * 6cd44f7	 speaker pin declaration wfixed
